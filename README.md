### Update your blog to be your online CV
Make sure that it has the following features:
●	It has at least the following pages (you may of course include the rest of the pages that you created before):
○	“Home” / “About Me” - add a photo of you, and a few words about yourself. Include the “front-end development” part
○	“My Online CV” - think about a format for your CV and start writing it in an HTML page. Describe the way 
○	“Show Off Page :D” / “Personal” / “Hobbies” / “Technical” / etc - use this to show off some of the technical things that you’ve learned and are proud of (the BMI calculator, a Chuck Norris joke, the weather with or without geolocation, currency exchange, trivia game, anything nice that you’ve implemented and are proud of)
●	It has a way of navigating between the pages (a menu present on all pages)
●	It is responsive
○	Decide on an external library that you’re using for this. Note: if possible, only use a grid, and style the rest yourself!
○	Define breakpoints
